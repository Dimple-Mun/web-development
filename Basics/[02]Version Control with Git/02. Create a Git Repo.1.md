# 1. Create A Git Repo From Scratch

## Command: `git init`

Before you can make commits or do anything else with a git repository, the repository needs to actually exist. To create a new repository with Git, we'll use the `git init` command.

The `init` subcommand is short for "initialize", which is helpful because it's the command that will do all of the initial setup of a repository. We'll look at what it does in just a second.

1. Create course directories
	- create a directory called  `udacity-git-course`
	- inside that, create another directory called  `new-git-project`
	- use the  `cd`  command to move into the  `new-git-project`  directory

	> 1. `cd` to where you want these files stored
	> 2. `mkdir -p udacity-git-course/new-git-project && cd $_`

2. Initialize an empty Git repository in the current directory: `git init`

## Effect of `git init`

Running the  `git init`  command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. All of these files are stored in a directory called  `.git`  (notice the  `.`  at the beginning - that means it'll be a hidden directory on Mac/Linux). This  `.git`  directory  _is the "repo"_! This is where git records all of the commits and keeps track of everything!

Let's take a brief look at the contents of the  `.git`  directory.

> WARNING: Don't directly edit any files inside the  `.git`  directory. This is the heart of the repository. If you change file names and/or file content, git will probably lose track of the files that you're keeping in the repo, and you could lose a lot of work! It's okay to look at those files though, but don't edit or delete them.

## .Git Directory Contents

_We're about to take a look at the  `.git`  directory...it's not vital for this course, though, so don't worry about memorizing anything, it's here if you want to dig a little deeper into how Git works under the hood._

Here's a brief synopsis on each of the items in the  `.git`  directory:

-   **config file**  - where all  _project specific_  configuration settings are stored.  
    From the  [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration):  
    
    > Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you’re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository.
    
    For example, let's say you set that the global configuration for Git uses your personal email address. If you want your work email to be used for a specific project rather than your personal email, that change would be added to this file.
    

-   **description file**  - this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can ignore it

-   **hooks directory**  - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events

-   **info directory**  - contains the global excludes file

-   **objects directory**  - this directory will store all of the commits we make

-   **refs directory**  - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")

Remember, other than the "hooks" directory, you shouldn't mess with pretty much any of the content in here. The "hooks" directory  _can_  be used to hook into different parts or events of Git's workflow, but that's a more advanced topic that we won't be getting into in this course.

## Git Init Recap

Use the  `git init`  command to create a new, empty repository in the current directory.

```
$ git init

```

Running this command creates a hidden  `.git`  directory. This  `.git`  directory is the brain/storage center for the repository. It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.

# 2. Clone An Existing Git Repo

## Command: `git clone`

## Why Clone?

First, what is cloning?

> to make an identical copy

What's the value of creating an identical copy of something, and how does this relate to Git and version control?

Why would you want to create an identical copy? Well, when I work on a new web project, I do the same set of steps:

-   create an  `index.html`  file
-   create a  `js`  directory
-   create a  `css`  directory
-   create an  `img`  directory
-   create  `app.css`  in the css directory
-   create  `app.js`  in the js directory
-   add starter HTML code in  `index.html`
-   add configuration files for linting (validating code syntax)
    -   [HTML linting](http://htmlhint.com/)
    -   [CSS linting](https://stylelint.io/)
    -   [JavaScript linting](http://eslint.org/)
-   [configure my code editor](http://editorconfig.org/)

...and I do this  _every time_  I create a new project!...which is a lot of effort I'm putting in for each new project. I didn't want to keep doing these same steps over and over, so I did all of the steps listed above one last time and created a starter project for myself. Now when I create a new project, I just make an identical copy of that starter project!

The way that cloning relates to Git is that the command we'll be running on the terminal is  `git clone`. You pass a path (usually a URL) of the Git repository you want to clone to the  `git clone`  command.

Wanna try cloning an existing project? Let's see how Git's  `clone`  command works!

## HINT: Verify Terminal Location

TIP: Now before you clone anything, make sure you are located in the correct directory on the command line. Cloning a project creates a new directory and places the cloned Git repository in it. The problem is that you can't have nested Git repositories. So make sure the terminal's current working directory isn't located in a Git repository. If your current working directory is not in your shell's prompt, type  `pwd`  to print the working directory.

## Cloning The Blog Repository

Ready? Let's get cloning!

The command is  `git clone`  and then you pass the path to the Git repository that you want to clone. The project that we'll be using throughout this course is located at this URL:  [https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project](https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project)  So using this URL, the full command to clone blog project is:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project
```

## Git Clone Output Explanation

Let's look briefly at the output that  `git clone`  displays.

The first line says "Cloning into 'course-git-blog-project'...". Git is creating a directory (with the same name of the project we're cloning) and putting the repository in it...that's pretty cool!

The rest of the output is basically validation - it's counting the remote repository's number of objects, then it compresses and receives them, then it unpacks them.

## Clone Project And Use Different Name

You just cloned the blog project for this course. Awesome job!

The command you ran in the terminal was:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project

```

...which created a directory named  `course-git-blog-project`.

What if you want to use a different name instead of the default one? Yes, you could just run the command above and manually rename it in Finder/Windows Explorer or use  `mv`  on the terminal. But that's too many steps for us! Instead, we'd rather clone the project and have it use a different name all in one go! But how do we do that?

`git clone  https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project blog-project`

## WARNING: Not In A Git Repository?

WARNING: Here's a  _very important_  step that often gets missed when you first start working with Git. When the  `git clone`  command is used to clone a repository, it creates a new directory for the repository...you already know this.  _But, it doesn't change your shell's working directory._  It created the new repo inside the current working directory, which means that the current working directory is still  _outside_  of this new Git repo! Make sure you  `cd`  into the new repository.

Remember to use the Terminal's command prompt as an aid - if you're in a directory that is a Git repository, the command prompt will include a name in parentheses.

## Look At The Project

So you've cloned the project to your computer, and you've  `cd`ed into it. Don't you think it's time you checked it out in a browser to see what it looks like?

Open up the  `index.html`  file in your favorite browser.

## Git Clone Recap

The  `git clone`  command is used to create an identical copy of an existing repository.

```
$ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>

```

This command:

-   takes the path to an existing repository
-   by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository that's being cloned
-   can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the directory
-   will create the new repository inside of the current working directory

## Status Update

At this point, we have two Git repositories:

-   the empty one that we created with the  `git init`  command
-   the one we cloned with the  `git clone`  command

How can we find any information about these repositories? Git's controlling them, but how can we find out what Git knows about our repos? To figure out what's going on with a repository, we use the  `git status`  command. Knowing the status of a Git repository is  _extremely_  important, so head straight on over to the next concept: Determine A Repo's Status.
